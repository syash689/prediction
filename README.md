Welcome to the "IPL Win Predictor" project! This machine learning model, built using logistic regression, predicts the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on the current match situation. Get ready to make data-driven predictions!

## About This Project

The "IPL Win Predictor" leverages logistic regression to provide insights into the probability of a team winning an IPL match. This model analyzes various match features, team performance, and player statistics to offer real-time predictions.


The predictor will calculate the probability of the batting team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
